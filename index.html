			The CARIT is an interdisciplinary research center that provides high quality survey research, program evaluation, performance measurement, and experimental research using scientifically rigorous information technology methods. 
			Our goal is to collaborate with other disciplines to find new opportunities to apply computing in new ways to solve today’s most challenging problems. The CARIT is a valuable resource for faculty in need of assistance for research projects, grants, and contracts. 
			In addition, organizations and agencies can utilize the CARIT in a variety of areas such as technology evaluations or business analysis. The CARIT will provide an environment that focuses on facilitating an applied learning environment for 
			Kennesaw State University graduate and undergraduate students with all aspects of computing and its applications in engineering, science, and technology.
			We hope that you will peruse the website to see what CARIT projects have been conducted or are in the works. You can also find information about the services available through CARIT.
