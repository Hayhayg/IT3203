<!--
	 This page3.html, about us, for the CARIT website. The body has a 2% margin. The header is 
	centered with the KSU logo and website title. The KSU logo links to the KSU website. The title is 
	appropriately <h1>. The navigation bar spans across the page with a 100% width. It is an unordered 
	list with the text centered, and the color of each link changes on hover. The footer has a relative 
	position to keep it at the bottom of the page. This is consistent on each page. 

	 In the body, there is a title followed by a table, which displays KSU events. The table contains a
	 header and four table rows with four pieces of table data in each. The table has a box shadow. One
	 column of the table has hyperlinks. The table is formatted in the CSS stylesheet.
